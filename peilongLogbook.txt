Wed 26 OCT 16
I attended the "Trigger for Physics" workshop in the morning and had lunch with all SMU people at CERN. Then I went to the Hbb meeting with Steve and Mattew at 1:30pm and went back to the afternon section of the workshop to listen the talk and the discussion for the trigger of 2017 run. I went to CERN building 55 to get my ID card. Then I attended the "b-jet trigger worshop" meeting. It is a service task workshop and I met some people I don't recognize there. After that, I had dinner with Steve and Matthew. We talked a lot about Mars, astronomy, space-time, universe fluctation. They talked about a movie - "Total Recall" 1990. I might watch it sometime. 

I also heard from Jeff and Steve that the 2 lepton data for Hbb framework is not found yet.

Service task waiting for Steve meeting with Argonne.

I also added the logbook and PhD thesis git repository.

yum check-update
    This command allows you to determine whether any updates are available for your installed packages. yum returns a list of all package updates from all repositories if any are available. 

yum update package_name
    Used to update the specified packages to the latest available version. If no packages are specified, then yum will attempt to update all installed packages.
    If the --obsoletes option is used (i.e. yum --obsoletes package_name), yum will process obsolete packages. As such, packages that are obsoleted across updates will be removed and replaced accordingly. 

It makes no difference whether double or single quotes are used when creating an alias.
    alias ll='ls -al'

RPM package install:
rpm -ivh package_name 

-i: install
-v: installation details
-h: installation progress
