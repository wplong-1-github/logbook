Wed 26 OCT 16
I attended the "Trigger for Physics" workshop in the morning and had lunch with all SMU people at CERN. Then I went to the Hbb meeting with Steve and Mattew at 1:30pm and went back to the afternon section of the workshop to listen the talk and the discussion for the trigger of 2017 run. I went to CERN building 55 to get my ID card. Then I attended the "b-jet trigger worshop" meeting. It is a service task workshop and I met some people I don't recognize there. After that, I had dinner with Steve and Matthew. We talked a lot about Mars, astronomy, space-time, universe fluctation. They talked about a movie - "Total Recall" 1990. I might watch it sometime. 

I also heard from Jeff and Steve that the 2 lepton data for Hbb framework is not found yet.

Service task waiting for Steve meeting with Argonne.

I also added the logbook and PhD thesis git repository.

xargs command is designed to construct argument lists and invoke other utility. xargs reads items from the standard input or pipes, delimited by blanks or newlines, and executes the command one or more times with any initial-arguments followed by items read from standard input.
