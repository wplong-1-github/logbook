Wed 26 OCT 16
I attended the "Trigger for Physics" workshop in the morning and had lunch with all SMU people at CERN. Then I went to the Hbb meeting with Steve and Mattew at 1:30pm and went back to the afternon section of the workshop to listen the talk and the discussion for the trigger of 2017 run. I went to CERN building 55 to get my ID card. Then I attended the "b-jet trigger worshop" meeting. It is a service task workshop and I met some people I don't recognize there. After that, I had dinner with Steve and Matthew. We talked a lot about Mars, astronomy, space-time, universe fluctation. They talked about a movie - "Total Recall" 1990. I might watch it sometime. 

I also heard from Jeff and Steve that the 2 lepton data for Hbb framework is not found yet.

Service task waiting for Steve meeting with Argonne.

I also added the logbook and PhD thesis git repository.

--------------
xargs command is designed to construct argument lists and invoke other utility. xargs reads items from the standard input or pipes, delimited by blanks or newlines, and executes the command one or more times with any initial-arguments followed by items read from standard input. Blank lines on the standard input are ignored.

yum check-update
    This command allows you to determine whether any updates are available for your installed packages. yum returns a list of all package updates from all repositories if any are available. 

yum update package_name
    Used to update the specified packages to the latest available version. If no packages are specified, then yum will attempt to update all installed packages.
    If the --obsoletes option is used (i.e. yum --obsoletes package_name), yum will process obsolete packages. As such, packages that are obsoleted across updates will be removed and replaced accordingly. 

It makes no difference whether double or single quotes are used when creating an alias.
    alias ll='ls -al'

RPM package install:
rpm -ivh package_name 

-i: install
-v: installation details
-h: installation progress

$ grep -r "192.168.1.5" /etc/
OR

yum how to check installed package:

yum list installed
    Lists all packages installed on your system. The rightmost column in the output lists the repository from which the package was retrieved. 


How to unpack .tar.gz
tar -xvzf community_images.tar.gz
To explain a little further, tar collected all the files into one package, community_images.tar. The gzip program applied compression, hence the gz extension. So the command does a couple things:

    f: this must be the last flag of the command, and the tar file must be immediately after. It tells tar the name and path of the compressed file.
    z: tells tar to decompress the archive using gzip
    x: tar can collect files or extract them. x does the latter.
    v: makes tar talk a lot. Verbose output shows you all the files being extracted.

C++ code naming convention:
file name must be lower case, underline is used to seperate words, such as my_useful_class.cc
class name must capitalize the First word, no underline included, such as MyExcitingClass
variable name must be lower case, underline is used to seperate words, such as string table_name, -- class data member follow the same naming rule
constant variable name: adding a "c" in front of the variables, such as const int cDaysInAWeek = 7;
function name: common function -> no underline, capitialize the first word, such as AddTableEntry() DeleteUrl() OpenFileOrDie()
	       set function & get function in the class -> the name should be corresponed to the variable name, such as:
	       	   class MyClass {
  		     public:
			...
			int num_entries() const { return num_entries_; }
        		void set_num_entries(int num_entries) { num_entries_ = num_entries; }

    		     private:
			int num_entries_;
		  };


Linux file naming convention:
. is used to separate a filetype extension, e.g. foo.txt.

- or _ is used to separate logical words, e.g. my-big-file.txt or sometimes my_big_file.txt. - is better because you don't have to press the Shift key, others prefer _ because it looks more like a space.

So if I understand your example, backup-part2-random or backup_part2_random would be closest to the normal Unix convention.

- Directory => uppercase
- file => lowercase
- space => '_' --Peilong's comment--|| "_" used to connect/seperate two close meaning words, such as "x86_64"  || version treated as 1 word, seperated by "."
- manually version control file => '-' as separator --Peilong's comment--|| "-" used to seperate words, such as kernel version 3.10.0-327.36.3.el7.x86_64 || directory generally follows the same rule as the file, but directory can use Uppercase if necessary.

I git push my work to a remote Git repository.
Every push will prompt me to input username and password. I would like to avoid it for every push, but how to configure to avoid it?

1. Generate an SSH key

Linux/Mac
Open terminal to create ssh keys:

cd ~                 #Your home directory
ssh-keygen -t rsa    #Press enter for all values

2. Associate the SSH key with the remote repository

This step varies, depending on how your remote is set up.

If it is a GitHub repository and you have administrative privileges, go to settings and click 'add SSH key'. Copy the contents of your ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub into the field labeled 'Key'.
If your repository is administered by somebody else, give the administrator your id_rsa.pub.

3. Set your remote URL to a form that supports SSH 1

If you have done the steps above and are still getting the password prompt, make sure your repo URL is in the form

git+ssh://git@github.com/username/reponame.git

as opposed to

https://github.com/username/reponame.git

To see your repo URL, run:

git remote show origin

You can change the URL with:

git remote set-url origin git@github.com/username/reponame.git

or 

emacs -nw .git/config
then edit the file:

[remote "origin"]
        url = git@github.com:wplongpub/language.git
